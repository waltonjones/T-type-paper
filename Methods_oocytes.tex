\subsection*{Functional expression of T-type channels in \emph{Xenopus} oocytes}

Linearized cDNAs encoding rat Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 or DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 were used as templates for the synthesis of capped cRNAs using T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).
cRNA concentrations were estimated based on spectrophotometric optical density measurements at 260 nm.
Oocyte preparation from female \emph{Xenopus laevis} and injection of cRNAs was performed as previously reported\cite{kang:2006aa}.
GenBank accession numbers: rat Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 ($\alpha$\textsubscript{1}G), AF027984\cite{PerezReyes:1998gn}; DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 C isoform, NP001096889.
