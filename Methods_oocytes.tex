\subsection*{Functional expression of T-type channels in \emph{Xenopus} oocytes}

The information of rat Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 ($\alpha$\textsubscript{1}G; GenBank accession number AF027984) used as a control was previously reported \cite{9495342}.
The GenBank accession number of the DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 is NP001096889.
Linearized cDNAs encoding rat Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 or DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 were used as a template for synthesis of capped cRNAs using T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).
The concentrations of cRNAs were estimated based on optical density measured at 260 nm with a spectrophotometer.
Preparation of oocytes from female \emph{Xenopus laevis} frogs and injection of rat Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 cRNAs or DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 cRNAs into oocytes were performed according to the previously reported methods \cite{16377633}.
