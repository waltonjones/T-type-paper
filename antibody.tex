\subsection*{Generation of antisera and western blot}

A polyclonal antiserum against DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 was generated by amplifying the coding sequence for 302 amino acids at its C-terminus (PCR primers: 5'-GAATTCCAAATTAATCCAATCCGTA-3' and 5'-GCGGCCGCTTAGTCCATGGAGGATT-3') and cloning it into the pET28a vector.
His-tagged antigen was expressed in and purified from an \emph{E. coli} culture and then injected into rabbits to generate an immune response (Young In Frontier, South Korea).
We performed our western blot analyses according to standard protocols using rabbit antisera obtained after the third DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 antigen boost and a $\beta$-Actin-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778) as a loading control.
