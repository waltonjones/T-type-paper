\subsection*{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 is broadly expressed in the adult brain}

To determine the expression pattern of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 in the adult brain, we first generated a \emph{white\textsuperscript{+}} DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Founder} allele in which a $\phi$C31 attP landing site and a floxed \emph{mini-white} marker replaces the first coding exon of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 via homologous recombination\cite{Huang:2009ei}.
We then removed the \emph{mini-white} marker via Cre-mediated recombination to produce a \emph{white\textsuperscript{-}} DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Founder} allele.
Finally, using $\phi$C31-mediated integration, we generated a GFP-tagged DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 knock-in allele, GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3, by inserting the coding sequence for GFP in-frame immediately after the transcriptional start site of the first DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 exon (Fig. \ref{fig:S1}).
In GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 flies, GFP signal appears broadly across the brain, with the antennal lobes, mushroom body calyces, and the optic lobes all showing strong staining (Fig. \ref{Fig 2}).
The strongest expression, though, is in the central complex, which comprises the ellipsoid body, fan-shaped body, noduli, and protocerebral bridge (Fig. ).
GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 channels are also expressed broadly in less structured neuropils including subesophageal zone (SEZ), superior neuropil (SNP), inferior neuropil (INP), ventrolateral neuropil (VLNP) and ventromedial neuropil (VMNP).

We next visualized the projections of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-expressing neurons using another knock-in allele, DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}.
In DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}, the Gal4 coding sequence replaces the first coding exon of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and its flanking introns to drive GAL4 expression under the control of the endogenous DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 promoter (Fig. \ref{fig:S1}).
We visualized the projections of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-positive neurons by using DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} to drive a membrane-tethered mCherry marker.
The strong co-localization of the mCherry signal in these flies with the GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 signal suggests both likely reflect the endogenous DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 expression pattern (Fig. \ref{fig:S2}).
