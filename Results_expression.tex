\subsection*{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 is broadly expressed in the adult brain}

To determine the expression pattern of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 in the adult brain, we generated GFP-tagged DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 allele.
First, we generated founder line (\emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Founder}})  by end-out homologous recombination for versatile allele generation\cite{Huang:2009ei} (Fig. \ref{fig:2}a).
 In \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Founder}}, about 2 kb of genomic  region including first coding exon was replaced by \emph{attP} site for  $\phi$C31-mediated DNA integration  and floxed \emph{white\textsuperscript{+}} marker. 
After removing \emph{white\textsuperscript{+}} marker in the \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Founder}} by Cre-mediated recombination, \emph{attB} vector (\emph{pGE-attB\textsuperscript{GMR}}) containing deleted genomic region with GFP and linker sequences inserted before the start codon in frame  was integrated into \emph{attP} site of founder line by $\phi$C31 integrase. 
Integration resulted in DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 tagged with GFP at its N-terminal end (\emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3}). 
In \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3} flies, GFP signal appears broadly across the brain (Fig. \ref{fig:2}b).
Expressed region includes well-structured neuropils like antennal lobe, mushroom body, central complex in the central brain (Fig. \ref{fig:2}c-h) and optic lobe as well as less-structured neuropil regions.
The strongest expression was detected in the central complex consisting four substructures of fan-shaped body, ellipsoid body, noduli and protocerebral bridge (Fig. \ref{fig:2}e and g) and the expression was predominent in ventral part of fan-shaped body and ventral noduli (Fig. \ref{fig:2}e). 
In mushroom body, \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3} was localized in postsynapse-rich calyx in dorso-posterior brain (Fig. \ref{fig:2}h) rather than axonal lobes in anterior brain (Fig. \ref{fig:2}d).
We observed \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3} expression only in the posterior part of peduncle, a fiber track of mushroom body joining the posterior calyx and anterior lobes (Fig. \ref{fig:2}f).
These results suggest strict regulation of subcellular localization of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 channels in the brain.


We also visualized the projections of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-expressing neurons using another knock-in allele, \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}}.
In \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}}, the Gal4 coding sequence replaces the first coding exon of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and its flanking introns to drive GAL4 expression under the control of the endogenous DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 promoter (Fig. \ref{fig:3}a).
We visualized the projections of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-positive neurons by using DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} to drive a membrane-tethered mCherry (UAS-mChRFP).
Consistent with \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3}, \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} showed broad expression pattern in the brain (Fig. \ref{fig:S1}a).
We observed strong co-localization of the \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}}-driven mCherry signal and \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3} in the neuropils (\ref{fig:S1}b and c}), suggesting both expressions are driven by the same endogenous DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 promoters.
