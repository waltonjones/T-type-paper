\section*{Abstract}

Mammalian T-type Ca\textsuperscript{2+} channels are encoded by three separate genes (Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1, 3.2, 3.3).
Some reports have implicated these T-type channels as sleep stabilizers that are important in the generation of the delta rhythms of deep sleep, but controversy remains.
Progress in identifying the physiological functions of the T-type channels has been hindered by many factors, including possible compensation between the products of these three genes and a lack of specific pharmacological inhibitors.
Invertebrates have only one T-type channel gene and its physiological functions are less well-studied.
We cloned DmCa\textsubscript{v}3, the only Ca\textsubscript{v}3 channel gene in the \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} genome, and found that it shows broad expression across the adult brain.
Voltage-clamp analysis revealed that the biophysical properties of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 are more similar to Ca\textsubscript{v}3.2 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.3 than Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1.
Flies lacking DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 show an abnormal increase in sleep duration that is most pronounced during subjective day under continuous dark conditions despite normal oscillations of the circadian clock.
Thus, our study suggests invertebrate T-type Ca\textsuperscript{2+} channels promote wakefulness rather than stabilizing sleep.
