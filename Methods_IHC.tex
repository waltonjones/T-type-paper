\subsection*{Immunohistochemistry}

Adult female fly brains were dissected in PBS and fixed with 4\% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Fixed brain samples were washed with PAT3 solution (0.5\% TritonX-100, 0.5\% BSA in PBS) for 15 min 3 times and incubated in 5\% normal goat serum for 2-3 hours at room temperature.
After blocking, samples were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5\% normal goat serum overnight at $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
The samples were then washed with PAT3 for 1 hour 2 times at room temperature and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in 5\% normal goat serum overnight at $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
After washing off the secondary antibodies with PAT3 for 1 hour 2 times, the brain samples were mounted in Vectashield (H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and visualized on a LSM-780 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germany).
Primary antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, A11122, Invitrogen); anti-bruchpilot monoclonal (1:50, nc82, DSHB).
Secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:300, A11008, Invitrogen); goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 (1:300, A11031, Invitrogen).
