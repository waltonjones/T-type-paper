\subsection*{Immunohistochemistry}

Adult brain of female flies was dissected in PBS and fixed with 4\% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Fixed brain samples were washed with PAT3 (0.5\% TritonX-100, 0.5\% BSA in PBS) for 15 min 3 times and incubated in 5\% normal goat serum for 1-2 hours at room temperature.
After blocking, samples were incubated with primary antibody overnight at $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
Samples were washed with PAT3 for 1 hour twice at room temperature and incubated with secondary antibody overnight at $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
After washed with PAT3 for 1 hour twice, brain samples were mounted with vectashield solution (H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Inc.).
Primary antibody used: rabbit anti-GFP antibody 1: 1000(A11122, Invitrogen); monoclonal anti-bruchpilot antibody (nc82, DSHB).
Secondary antibody used: Goat anti-rabbit Alexa488 1:400 (A11008, Invitrogen); Goat anti-mouse Alexa568 1:400 (A11031, Invitrogen).
