\subsection*{Immunohistochemistry}

Adult brains of female flies were dissected in PBS and fixed with 4\% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Fixed brain samples were washed with PAT3 solution (0.5\% TritonX-100, 0.5\% BSA in PBS) for 15 min 3 times and incubated in 5\% normal goat serum for 2-3 hours at room temperature.
After blocking, samples were incubated with primary antibody diluted in 5\% normal goat serum overnight at $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
Samples were washed with PAT3 for 1 hour twice at room temperature and incubated with secondary antibody diluted in 5\% normal goat serum overnight at $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.
After washed with PAT3 for 1 hour twice, brain samples were mounted with vectashield solution (H-1000, Vector Laboratories, Inc.).
Primary antibody used: rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:500, A11122, Invitrogen; ); monoclonal anti-bruchpilot antibody (1:50, nc82, DSHB).
Secondary antibody used: goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:300, A11008, Invitrogen); goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 (1:300, A11031, Invitrogen).
