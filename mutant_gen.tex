\subsection*{Generation of knock-in alleles}

Knock-in alleles were generated by targeted site-specific DNA integration.
5' and 3' homologous arms were PCR amplified using w\textsuperscript{1118} genomic DNA with primer sets (5'- CGAGATGAATTCTAGCCTCATCAACTGAGC-3' and 5'- CGAGATGCGGCCGCGAGCAAGCACTAATAGCA

-3' for 5arm; 5'-GAGATACTAGTCATGCTACAATGTCAGCA-3 and 5'-CGAGATCTCGAGGGCCACGTATAGGGATGC-3' for 3arm) and inserted into \href{https://dgrc.cgb.indiana.edu/product/View?product=1293}{pGX-attP vector}.
P{Donor} line was generated by P-element based transgenesis of cloned pGX-attP vector into fly genome (Genetic Services, Inc., US) and crossed with Flp I-Sce I line for homologous recombination.
Candidate targeting lines with red eye or mosaic eyes are selected and verified by PCR.
Verified line was white marker-removed by Cre recombination and used as founder line (DmCa\textsubscript{v}3Founder) for site-specific DNA integration.

DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}, DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Rescue} and GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 lines were generated by phiC31 integrase based site-specific integration.
Gal4 construct (Splicing acceptor-Gal4 CDS-poly A) was amplified from \href{https://dgrc.cgb.indiana.edu/product/View?product=1325}{pBS-KS-attB1-2-GT-SA-GAL4-Hsp70pA vector} with primer set (5'-CGTACTCCACGAATTTCTAGAAGTCGATCCAACAT-3' and 5'-ACCGGCGCGCCTCGACTCTAGAACTAGTGGATCTA-3').
Amplified DNA fragment were sequenced and inserted into the \href{https://dgrc.cgb.indiana.edu/product/View?product=1295}{pGE-attBGMR vector} using EZ-FusionTM cloning kit (Enzynomics).
Rescue construct were PCR amplified using w\textsuperscript{1118} genomic DNA as template with primer set (5'-gcaGAATTCAATCGATTCCATAGATCCGC-3' and 5'-GCACTCGAGAATTTTGCAACAGGCAGCTA-3') and inserted into the pGE-attBGMR vector at EcoR I/Xho I site. 

GFP containing fragment and (GlyGlySer)4 linker were amplified from the \href{https://dgrc.cgb.indiana.edu/product/View?product=1306}{pBS-KS-attB1-2-PT-SA-SD-1-EGFP-FIAsH-StrepII-TEV-3xFlag vector} with primer set (5'-GCACCCCAGAAAATGGTGTCCAAGGGCGAGGAGCT-3' and 5'-CGCTGGCTGTGGCAGGGAACCTCCGCTTCCACCGC-3').
Amplified fragment was then inserted into 3' downstream of ATG translation start site in Rescue construct by inverse PCR (5'-CTGCCACAGCCAGCGGCAGCG-3' and 5'-CATTTTCTGGGGTGCCAACTA-3') using 5X In-Fusion HD Enzyme Premix (Clontech).  

pGE-attBGMR vectors containing each of Gal4, Rescue and GFP tagging constructs were injected into DmCa\textsubscript{v}3Founder embryo (Rainbow Transgenic Flies, Inc., US) for phiC31 mediated site-specific integration of each constructs into attP site in DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 locus.
DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} and DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Rescue} were white marker-removed for further behavior analysis.
