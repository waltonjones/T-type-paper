\subsection*{Sleep and circadian assays}

Sleep and locomotor behavior of flies were measured using Drosophila Activity Monitoring system (Trikinetics).
3-4 old flies were placed into 65 mm X 5mm glass tube individually with one end filled with 2\% agar/ 5\% sucrose food and the other end capped by cotton ball.
Activity is counted every bim break in 1 min bin.
5 minutes and more inactivity were counted as sleep conventionally.
After one day of habituation in the incubator, sleep during two days of 12hr:12hr light-dark cycle and following two days of dark period was analysed.

Circadian locomotion was measured every 30 min bin and analysed using ClockLab analysis software (Actimetrics) with the significance level of the $\chi$\textsuperscript{2} periodogram set to $\alpha$ = 0.05.
Flies with a $\Xi$2 statistic $\geq$10 over the significance line were scored as rhythmic.
