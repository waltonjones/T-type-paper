\subsection*{Sleep and locomotor behavior analysis}

Sleep and locomotor behavior of flies were measured using Drosophila Activity Monitoring system (Trikinetics).
For sleep analysis, 3-4 old female flies were placed into 65 mm X 5mm glass tube individually with one end filled with 2\% agar/ 5\% sucrose food and the other end capped by cotton ball.
Activity is counted every bim break in 1 min bin and 5 minutes and more inactivity were counted as sleep \cite{10710313}.
After one day of habituation in the incubator ($25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, 60\% humidity) sleep during two days of 12hr:12hr light-dark cycle and following two days of dark period was analysed using Counting Macro \cite{21041393}.

Circadian locomotion was measured every 30 min bin and analysed using ClockLab analysis software (Actimetrics) with the significance level of the $\chi$\textsuperscript{2} periodogram set to $\alpha$ = 0.05.
Flies with a $\chi$\textsuperscript{2} statistic $\geq$10 over the significance line were scored as rhythmic.
