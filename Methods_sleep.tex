\subsection*{Sleep and locomotor behavior analysis}

Fly sleep and locomotor behavior was measured with the \emph{Drosophila} Activity Monitoring system (Trikinetics).
For sleep analysis, 3-4 day-old female flies were placed individually into 65 mm X 5 mm glass tubes with one end filled with 2\% agar / 5\% sucrose food and the other end plugged with cotton.
We defined periods of activity as periods with a beam break frequency higher than 1 per minute and periods of sleep as periods during which no beam break occurred for at least 5 consecutive minutes\cite{Shaw:2000ui}.
After one day of habituation in an incubator (25$\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, 60\% humidity), we used the ``Counting Macro'' software\cite{pfeiffenberger:2010ab} to measure sleep over the course of 4 days---2 days of 12 hr:12 hr light-dark conditions and 2 days of continuous darkness.
For experiments using the GeneSwitch technique, flies were maintained on normal food containing 500 $\mu$M RU486 (M8046, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in ethanol (1\%) for two days prior to the experiment.
Control flies were maintained on normal food containing only ethanol (1\%).
During the GeneSwitch experiments, flies were placed in 2\% agar / 5\% sucrose food with or without 500 $\mu$M RU486.
For sleep deprivation experiment, activity monitors with 3-5 day-old female flies were placed in the apparatus designed to rotate and give a mechanical stimuli about twice a minute.
After three days of 12 hr:12 hr light-dark cycle in the apparatus, files were sleep-deprived for 24 hr and recovered for following 12 hr (light period). To calculate percentage of sleep recovered (\% $\Delta$Sleep), baseline sleep (sleep during light period before the deprivation day) was subtracted from recovery sleep and then this value was divided by sleep lost.
We only included the flies with deprivation percentage $\geq$ 70.
For the circadian locomotor analyses, we measured the activity of 1-3 day-old male flies in 30 minute bins and analyzed the data using ClockLab (Actimetrics) and the Counting Macro\cite{pfeiffenberger:2010aa}. Significance level for the $\chi$\textsuperscript{2} periodogram was set to $\alpha$ = 0.05.
Flies with a power of significance (P-S) $\geq$10 were considered rhythmic.
