\subsection*{Generation deletion alleles using imprecise P-element excision}

EP line G1047 flies were crossed to lines with transposase(\emph{Dr[1]/TMS,Sb,P[$\Delta$2-3}). Progenies with mosaic eyes were collected and crossed to X chromosome balancer line to obtain candidate excision lines. Candidate lines were PCR verified and backcrossed to \emph{w\textsuperscript{1118}} for more than 8 times for sleep analysis.
