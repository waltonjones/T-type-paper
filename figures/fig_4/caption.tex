\textbf{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} mutant shows rhythmic circadian locomotion and transcriptional oscillation of clock genes.}
\\
\textbf{A.} Averaged activity in day 2 of three LD cycle (LD2) and day 2 of DD cycle (DD2), actograms are shown.
Values for period, P-S and rhythmicity are indicated in left.
w\textsuperscript{1118} as control and DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} mutant.
\textbf{B.} Quantitative PCR analysis shows DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} has transcriptional oscillation of period in DD.
rp49 was used for normalization.
