\textbf{\emph{Knock-down of Ca-\alpha1T with the \emph{Ca-\alpha1T\textsuperscript{Gal4}}} driver increases sleep in constant darkness.}
\\
\textbf{(a)} Sleep profiles of \emph{Ca-\alpha1T\textsuperscript{Gal4}/+} (black, n=63), \emph{UAS-Ca-\alpha1T-IR/+} (grey, n=63) and \emph{Ca-\alpha1T\textsuperscript{Gal4}$>$Ca-\alpha1T-IR} (orange, n=59) over two days of 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD) and four days of continuous darkness (DD).
Sleep is plotted in 30 minute intervals.
White, black, and grey bars denote light phase, dark phase, and subjective light phase, respectively.
ZT, zeitgeber time.
CT, circadian time.
\textbf{(b)} Quantification of the average total sleep from (a).
Data are presented as means $\pm$ standard error of the mean (SEM).
Significance was determined with the one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-HSD post hoc tests.
**\emph{p}$<$0.01, ***\emph{p}$<$0.001.
