\textbf{Adult stage-specific knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep in constant darkness.}
\\
Sleep during subjective daytime and subjective nighttime in continuous darkness (DD). 
Flies fed RU486 as adults (\emph{elav-GS$>$DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR}, black) sleep significantly longer during subjective daytime in the day 2 of DD when compared to RU486-unfed controls (\emph{elav-GS$>$DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR}, white).
SL, subjective light-phase.
SD, subjective dark-phase.
Data are presented as means $\pm$ standard error of the mean (SEM).
Significance was determined using the one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-HSD post hoc tests.
