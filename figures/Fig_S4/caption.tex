\textbf {(b)} Averaged sleep amount over two days of continuous dark condition (DD).
White, grey, black bar denotes RNAi control, Gal4 control and Gal4 driven DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR(Gal4\textgreater{}DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR), respectively (n=21-83).
PI, pars intercerebralis, MB, mushroom body. 
Data are presented as means $\pm$ s.e.m..
For statistical analysis, Welch's ANOVA followed by Games-Howell post hoc test was performed.
