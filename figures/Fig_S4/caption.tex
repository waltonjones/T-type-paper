\textbf {(b)} Average total sleep over two days of continuous darkness (DD).
White, grey, and black bars denote \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR/+}, \emph{Gal4/+} and \emph{Gal4$>$DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR}, respectively (n=21-83).

Data are presented as means $\pm$ s.e.m..
Statistical significance was determined using Welch's ANOVA followed by the Games-Howell post hoc test.
