\textbf{Adult stage-specific knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep in constant darkness.}
\\
Sleep during subjective daytime in continuous darkness (DD). 
Flies fed RU486 as adults (\emph{elav-GS$>$DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR}, black) sleep significantly longer during the second day of continuous darkness when compared to RU486-unfed controls (\emph{elav-GS$>$DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR}, white).
Data are presented as means $\pm$ s.e.m..
Significance was determined using the one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-HSD post hoc tests.
*\emph{p}$<$0.05.
