\textbf{Knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 in glutamatergic neurons increases sleep in continuous dark period.}
\\
\textbf{A.} Averaged sleep amount over two days of continuous dark period in various neuronal Gal4-driven knock-down lines.
PI, pars intercerebralis, MB, mushroom body.
\textbf{B.} Sleep profiles of Vglut-Gal4/+ (black, n=38), UAS- DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 RNAi/+ (gray, n=42) and Vglut-Gal4/+; DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-RNAi/+ (orange, n=44) over two days of 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD) and two days of continuous dark condition (DD).
Sleep in 30 minute intervals was plotted.
White, black and gray bar denote light phase, dark phase and subjective light phase, respectively.
ZT, zeitgeber time.
CT, circadian time.
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ sem.
Welch's t-test was performed.
