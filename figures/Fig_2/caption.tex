\textbf{Expression of GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 in the adult brain} 
\\ 
\textbf{(a)} Schematic representation of Gene targeting and \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3} generation. 
Coding exons are shown in red. 
See method for detailed explanation.
\textbf{(b)} Overall expression patterns of \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3} in adult brain was visualized with GFP antibody (green). 
Maximum intensity projections of confocal images of anterior (b1), middle (b2), posterior (b3) parts are shown.
\textbf{(c-h)} Expressions of \emph{GFP::DmCa\textsubscript{v}3} in specific neurofils. Location of neurofils in the brain is correspond to the boxed area in (b).
AL, antennal lobe. 
SOG, subesophageal ganglion. 
FB, fan-shaped body. 
EB, ellipsoid body.
NO, noduli. 
PB, protocerebral bridge. 
MB, mushroom body.  
MB peduncle (A) and (P), anterior and posterior part of MB peducle respectively.
nc82  antibody ($\alpha$-Bruchpilot, magenta) was used to visualize neuropil structures.
