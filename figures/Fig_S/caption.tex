\textbf{Adult stage-specific knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep in constant darkness.}
\\
Sleep during subjective daytime in continuous dark period (DD). 
Flies fed RU486 in adult stage (\emph{Elav-GS\textgreater{}RNAi}, black) show significantly increased sleep in second day of DD compared to unfed control flies (\emph{Elav-GS\textgreater{}RNAi}, white).
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ s.e.m.
For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-HSD post hoc test was performed.
