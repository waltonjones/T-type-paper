\textbf{ \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} mutant shows rhythmic circadian locomotion and transcriptional oscillation of \emph{period}.}
\\
\textbf{(a)} Averaged activity profiles of second day of three 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD, left panel), second day of continuous dark period (DD, middle panel) and throughout the behavioral analysis (2 LD + 7 DD) are shown.
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ s.e.m. in left and middle panel.
White, black and grey bar denote light phase, dark phase and subjective light phase, respectively.
The number of flies (n=37-54) , period of rhythmic flies (n=26-50), power of rhythmicity (P-S) and percentage of rhythmic flies (rhythmicity) are indicated in right panel.
Mann-Whitney U test for period (*p$<$0.05) and welch's t-test for P-S (***p$<$0.001). 
\textbf{(b)} Transcriptional oscillation of \emph{period} gene in  \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} in DD. Black and red lines denote \emph{w\textsuperscript{1118}} and \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} respectively. rp49 was used for normalization.
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ s.e.m.
a.u., arbitrary unit.
