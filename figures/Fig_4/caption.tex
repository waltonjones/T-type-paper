\label{fig:4}
\textbf{ \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} mutant shows rhythmic circadian locomotion and transcriptional oscillation of \emph{period}.}
\\
\textbf{(a)} Averaged activity profiles of second day of three LD cycle (LD, left panel), second day of DD cycle (DD, middle panel) and throughout the behavioral analysis (2 LD + 7 DD) are shown. 
The number of flies (n=37-54) , period (n = 26-50), power of rhythmicity (P-S) and percentage of rhythmic flies (rhythmicity) are indicated in right panel.  
\textbf{(b)}  Transcriptional oscillation of \emph{period} gene in  \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} in DD. rp49 was used for normalization. a.u., arbitrary unit.
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ SEM.
