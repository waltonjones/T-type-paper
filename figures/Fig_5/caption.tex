\textbf{Pan-neuronal Ca-$\alpha$1T knockdown increases sleep.}
\\
\textbf{(a)} Sleep profiles of over two days of 12h:12h light-dark cycles (LD) and two days of continuous darkness (DD). Pan-neuronal knockdown of Ca-$\alpha$1T (\emph{elav$>$Ca-$\alpha$1T-IR}, orange, n=44) increases sleep beyond that of the heterozygous Gal4 control (\emph{elav-Gal4/+}, black, n=38) and the heterozygous UAS control (\emph{UAS-Ca-$\alpha$1T-IR/+}, grey, n=42).
Sleep is plotted in 30 minute intervals.
White, black, and grey bars denote light phase, dark phase, and subjective light phase, respectively.
ZT, zeitgeber time.
CT, circadian time.
\textbf{(b)} Quantification of average total sleep over two days of light-dark cycles (LD) and two days of continuous darkness (DD).
Data are presented as means $\pm$ standard error of the mean (SEM) and analyzed via one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-HSD post hoc test.
