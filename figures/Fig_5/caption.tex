\textbf{Pan-neuronal knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep.}
\\
\textbf{(a)} Sleep profiles of over two days of 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD) and two days of continuous dark condition (DD). Pan-neuronal gal4 driven DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 RNAi flies (\emph{Elav$>$RNAi}, orange line, n=44) have increased sleep compared to both gal4 control(\emph{elav-gal4/+}, black line, n=38) and UAS control (\emph{UAS-DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 RNAi/+}, grey line, n=42). 
Sleep in 30 minute intervals was plotted.
White, black and grey bar denote light phase, dark phase and subjective light phase, respectively.
ZT, zeitgeber time.
CT, circadian time.
\textbf{(b)} Quantification of average sleep amount over two days of light-dark cycle (LD) and two days of continuous dark condition (DD).
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ s.e.m.
For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-HSD post hoc test was performed.
