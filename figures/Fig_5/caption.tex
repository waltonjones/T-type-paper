\textbf{Pan-neuronal knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep.}
\\
\textbf{A.} Sleep profiles of elav-gal4/+ (black, n=38), UAS- DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 RNAi/+ (gray, n=42) and elav-gal4/+; DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-RNAi/+ (orange, n=44) over two days of 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD) and two days of continuous dark condition (DD).
Sleep in 30 minute intervals was plotted.
White, black and gray bar denote light phase, dark phase and subjective light phase, respectively.
ZT, zeitgeber time.
CT, circadian time.
\textbf{B.} Quantification of average sleep amount over two days light-dark condition (LD) and two days of continuous dark condition (DD).
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ s.e.m.
For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U test was performed.
