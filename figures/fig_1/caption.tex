{\bf Generation and validation of a library of UAS-miRNA \emph{Drosophila} stocks.} 
\textbf{A}. Vector schematic for UAS-miRNA generation. All miRNAs (clustered and individual) were inserted into a multiple cloning site in the 3'-UTR of a fluorescent marker. \textbf{B}. DsRed fluorescence induced in the eye with GMR-GAL4 is a proxy for miR-986 expression (center). Heterozygous GMR-GAL4 and UAS-miR-986 controls (left and right, respectively) show only low levels of auto-fluorescence. \textbf{C}. miRNA expression in developing wings using nubbin-GAL4 induces hyperproliferation (miR-133), loss of marginal bristles and cross-veins (miR-3/309), severe malformations (miR-137 and miR-1009) as well as simple notching (miR-2a-1). \textbf{D}. GMR-GAL4 driven expression of several miRNAs induces rough, small, smooth, necrotic, or de-pigmented eyes.}
