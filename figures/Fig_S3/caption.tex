\textbf{\emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}}-driven knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep in constant darkness.}
\\
\textbf{(a)} Sleep profiles of \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}/+} (n=63), \emph{UAS-DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-RNAi/+} (n=63) and \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}$>$DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-RNAi} (n=59) over two days of 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD) and four days of continuous dark condition (DD).
Sleep in 30 minute intervals was plotted.
White, black and gray bar denote light phase, dark phase and subjective light phase, respectively.
ZT, zeitgeber time.
CT, circadian time.
\textbf{(b)} Quantification of averaged sleep.
Data are represented as mean $\pm$ sem.
For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-HSD post hoc test was performed.
**p$<$0.01, ***p$<$0.001.
