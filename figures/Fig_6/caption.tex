\textbf {(a)} Average total sleep over two days of 12h:12h light-dark cycles (LD).
\textbf {(b)} Average total sleep over two days of continuous darkness (DD).
White, grey, and black bars denote \emph{UAS-Ca-$\alpha$1T-IR/+}, \emph{Gal4/+} and \emph{Gal4$>$Ca-$\alpha$1T-IR}, respectively (n=21--83).
PI, pars intercerebralis, MB, mushroom body. 
Data are presented as means $\pm$ standard error of the mean (SEM).
Statistical significance was determined using Welch's ANOVA followed by the Games-Howell post hoc test.
