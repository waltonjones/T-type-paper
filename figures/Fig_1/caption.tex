\textbf{Comparing the biophysical properties of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and rat Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1.}
\\
\textbf{(a)} (Left) Representative current traces through DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 expressed in \emph{Xenopus} oocytes. 
In 10 mM Ba\textsuperscript{2+}, currents were elicited by depolarizing step pulses separated by 10 mV increments from \textminus70 mV to +40 mV from a holding potential of \textminus90 mV. 
(Right) I-V relationships of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1. 
Peak currents for each oocyte were normalized to the maximum current. 
Percent amplitudes (mean $\pm$ s.e.m.) from oocytes expressing DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 ($\fullmoon$) or Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 ($\square$) plotted against the test potentials and fitted with the Boltzmann equation. 
\textbf{(b)} (Left) Steady-state inactivation was measured during voltage steps to \textminus20 mV after 10 s prepulses to potentials between \textminus100 mV and \textminus40 mV. 
(Right) Voltage-dependent activation and steady-state inactivation curves of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 ($\fullmoon$, $\newmoon$) and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 ($\square$, $\blacksquare$) plotted and fitted with the Boltzmann equation. 
\textbf{(c)} The activation time constant ($\tau$\textsubscript{act}) and inactivation time constant ($\tau$\textsubscript{inact}) of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 ($\fullmoon$) and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 ($\square$) were obtained by curve fitting the current traces with double exponentials. 
\textbf{(d)} Voltage-dependent deactivation of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 in HEK-293 cells.
Tail currents were elicited by application of repeated step pulses to \textminus20 mV for 10 ms, followed by various re-polarizing potentials ranging from \textminus120 mV to \textminus50 mV. 
Deactivation time constants were obtained by fitting tail current traces with a single exponential and plotted against re-polarizing potentials. 
\textbf{(e)} I\textsubscript{Ca}/I\textsubscript{Ba} ratios of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1. 
(Left) Representative current traces through DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 measured in 10 mM Ba\textsuperscript{2+} or 10 mM Ca\textsuperscript{2+} elicited by 10 mV step pulses from a holding potential of \textminus90 mV.
Ba\textsuperscript{2+} currents are in black; Ca\textsuperscript{2+} currents are in grey. 
(Middle) I-V relationships of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 ($\fullmoon$}, $\newmoon$) and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 ($\square$, $\blacksquare$) in 10 mM Ba\textsuperscript{2+} (open) or 10 mM Ca\textsuperscript{2+} (filled).  
(Right) The peak current ratios (I\textsubscript{Ca}/I\textsubscript{Ba}) for DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 (n=5, 4) and relative slope conductance (G\textsubscript{MaxCa}/G\textsubscript{MaxBa}) (n=6, 4) in 10 mM Ca\textsuperscript{2+} and 10 mM Ba\textsuperscript{2+}.

\textbf{(f)} Nickel inhibition sensitivity of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1. 
(Left) Representative current traces of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 at the indicated Ni\textsuperscript{2+} concentrations. 
(Right) Dose-response curves indicating Ni\textsuperscript{2+}-dependent inhibition of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 ($\fullmoon$) and Ca\textsubscript{v}3.1 ($\square$) obtained by fitting the averaged data with the Hill equation.
