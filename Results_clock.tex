\subsection*{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 mutant does not affect core clock system}

Sleep is regulated by circadian system and some clock mutants show altered sleep phenotype\cite{12568241, 19038223}.
We examined whether this increased sleep phenotype is due to altered circadian clock.
Activity of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} was monitored for more than seven days of continuous darkness (Fig. \ref{fig:4}A).
DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} showed somewhat decreased, but significant activity rhythms (70.6\% rhythmicity) in continuous darkness compared to w\textsuperscript{1118} background control (90.7\% rhythmicity).
Decreased power of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} (24.0 $\pm$ 3.4) compared to w\textsuperscript{1118} (61.4 $\pm$ 6.5) reflect increased sleep at the transition of subjective day and night period.
Consistent with circadian locomotion, transcription level of period which is one of the clock genes showed normal circadian oscillation in DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4} in continuous dark period (Fig. \ref{fig:4}B).
These data suggest sleep phenotype of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 mutant are not due to altered clock system.
