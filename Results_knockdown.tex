\subsection*{Pan-neuronal knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep}

We next asked whether the increased sleep phenotype of \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} flies can be attributed to the function of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 in the brain.
Pan-neuronal knockdown of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 (\emph{elav-gal4>UAS-DmCa\textsubscript{v}3-IR) increases sleep beyond that of heterozygous controls under both LD and DD conditions (Fig \ref{fig:5}).

We also examined whether adult stage-specific knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 induces increased sleep.
DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 knock-down by drug-inducible pan-neuronal gal4 driver (\emph{Elav-GeneSwitch(GS)-gal4}) increased sleep in DD compared to drug unfed control (Fig.\ref{fig:S4}), suggesting sleep phenotype of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 mutants are not due to the developmental defect.

Next, we wondered if any specific brain area is responsible for sleep regulating role of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3.
We knock downed DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 using broad neuronal gal4 drivers as well as specific gal4 drivers that cover previously known sleep regulating centers.
None of these gal4-driven knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 induced sleep increase (Fig. \ref{fig:S4}), suggesting DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 may function in previously unknown circuits or function in more broad area that any specific gal4 lines used did not cover.
