\subsection*{Pan-neuronal knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 increases sleep}

We examined whether neuronal T-type channel is responsible for increased sleep of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 mutants.
Pan-neuronal knockdown of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 using elav-gal4 driven DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 RNAi expression increased sleep both LD and DD, showing neuronal T-type Ca\textsuperscript{2+} channel is responsible for sleep regulation (Fig \ref{fig:5}).
Knockdown of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 with \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} driver also showed increased sleep after third day of continuous dark phase ensuring that gal4 expression of \emph{DmCa\textsubscript{v}3\textsuperscript{Gal4}} represents endogenous DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 expression (Fig. \ref{fig:S3}). 

Next, we wondered if any specific brain area is responsible for sleep regulating role of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3.
We knock downed DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 using broad neuronal gal4 drivers as well as specific gal4 drivers that cover previously known sleep regulating centers.
None of these gal4-driven knock-down of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 induced sleep increase (Fig. \ref{fig:S4}), suggesting DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 may function in previously unknown circuits or function in more broad area that any specific gal4 lines used did not cover.
