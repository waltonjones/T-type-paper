\subsection*{Antibody generation and western blotting}

A polyclonal antisera against Ca-$\alpha$1T was generated using antigen derived from the 302 C-terminal amino acids of Ca-$\alpha$1T (cloning primers: \seqsplit{5'-GAATTCCAAATTAATCCAATCCGTA-3'}, \seqsplit{5'-GCGGCCGCTTAGTCCATGGAGGATT-3'}).
His-tagged antigen was expressed in \emph{E. coli}, purified and injected into rabbits to generate an immune response (YoungIn Frontier, South Korea).
Western blot analyses were performed according to standard protocols using rabbit antisera obtained after the third Ca-$\alpha$1T antigen boost.
$\beta$-Actin-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778) were used for the loading control.
