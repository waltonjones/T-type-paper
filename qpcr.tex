\subsection*{qPCR}

Adult fly heads were collected each time point in constant darkness.
Total RNA were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo scientific).
qPCR was performed using TOPreal qPCR 2x premix (RT500M, Enzynomics, South Korea).
Primer sets used: rp49 (5'-ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATA-3', 5'-GAGAACGCAGGCGACCGTTG-3'), period (5'-GACCGAATCCCTGCTCAATA-3', 5'-GTGTCATTGGCGGACTTCTT-3')
