\subsection*{Statistical analysis}

Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.2.0)\cite{R} except data analysis of electrophysiological recordings (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
For comparison between two genotypes, we used student's t-test or Welch's t-test as described in the figure legends.
Mann-Whitney U test was performed for data with non-normal distribution.
For comparison among three and more genotypes, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey HSD post hoc test. 
Welch's one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Games-Howell post hoc test was performed for data with unequal variance.
We used "car"\cite{car} and "userfriendlyscience"\cite{user} R packages for Levene's test for homogeneity of variances and Welch's one-way ANOVA test, respectively.
