\subsection*{Statistical analysis}

All statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.2.0)\cite{R} except for the analysis of the electrophysiological recordings, which was performed in GraphPad (San Diego, CA, USA).
For comparisons between two genotypes, we used the Student's t-test or Welch's t-test as described in the figure legends.
The Mann-Whitney U test was substituted when the data did not follow a normal distribution.
For comparisons among three or more genotypes, we used the one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey HSD post hoc test. 
When the data had unequal variance, we used Welch's one-way ANOVA followed by the Games-Howell post hoc test.
We used the "car"\cite{car} and "userfriendlyscience"\cite{user} R packages to perform Levene's test for homogeneity of variance and the Games-Howell post hoc test, respectively.
