\subsection*{Statistical analysis}

Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.2.0)\cite{undefined} except data analysis of electrophysiological recordings (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
We used "car" and "userfriendlyscience" R packages.
If data is normally distributed, Welch's t-test was performed.
If data is not normally distributed, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test was performed.
