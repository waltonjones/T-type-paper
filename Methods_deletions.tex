\subsection*{Generation of deletion mutants of DmCa\textsubscript{v}3 using imprecise P-element excision}

EP line G1047 from the \href{http://genexel.kaist.ac.kr}{Genexel collection} was crossed to the transposase line (\emph{Dr[1]/TMS,Sb,P[$\Delta$2-3]}). Mosaic-eyed progeny were collected and crossed to an X chromosome balancer (\emph{phl12/FM6}) to obtain candidate excision lines. These candidates were then verified by PCR and backcrossed to \emph{w\textsuperscript{1118}} for more than 8 generations before continuing to the sleep analyses.
