\subsection*{Chemicals and preparation of solutions}

Most of chemicals for electrophysiological recordings were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
A 100 mM nickel-chloride stock solution was made in deionized water.
A series of nickel solutions (in $\mu$M: 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, and 3000) were prepared by diluting the stock solution with 10 mM Ba\textsuperscript{2+} recording solution (in mM: 10 BaOH\textsubscript{2}, 90 NaOH, 1 KOH, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with methanesulfonic acid) before every nickel inhibition experiment.
