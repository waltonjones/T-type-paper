\subsection*{qPCR}

Adult fly heads were collected each time point in second day of constant darkness.
Total RNA were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo scientific).
qPCR was performed using TOPreal qPCR 2x premix (RT500M, Enzynomics, South Korea). Expression levels of \emph{period} gene was normalized to rp49 levels.
Primer sets used: period (5'-GACCGAATCCCTGCTCAATA-3', 5'-GTGTCATTGGCGGACTTCTT-3'), rp49 (5'-ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATA-3', 5'-GAGAACGCAGGCGACCGTTG-3')
