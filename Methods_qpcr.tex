\subsection*{Quantitative real-time PCR}

Male adult flies were maintained for 2 days under 12h:12h light-dark conditions and 2 days of continuous darkness. \textcolor{red}{Is this correct? 4 days total, meaning 2 each of LD and DD?}
120--150 fly heads were collected for each time point (CT0-CT20) during the second day of continuous darkness.
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific).
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the TOPreal qPCR 2x premix (RT500M, Enzynomics, South Korea).
Expression levels of \emph{period} were normalized to the level of \emph{rp49}.
Primers: \emph{per} (5'-GACCGAATCCCTGCTCAATA-3', 5'-GTGTCATTGGCGGACTTCTT-3'); \emph{rp49} (5'-ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATA-3', 5'-GAGAACGCAGGCGACCGTTG-3').
